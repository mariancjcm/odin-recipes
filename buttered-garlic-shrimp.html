        <p>Garlic Butter Shrimp is a super easy dish to make. This recipe shows how to cook this beloved dish the Filipino way. I like how it turned out. The dish is rich and flavorful. <em>I enjoyed eating it with newly cooked white rice</em></p>
        <p>Garlic butter shrimp with sauce is topped over warm white rice. It can be eaten without any additional condiments because it is tasty by itself. I also like having this with toasted slices of French bread.</p>
