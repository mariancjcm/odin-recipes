        <p>Filipino Carbonara is more of a pasta Alfredo with bacon. It is richer and creamier than the traditional version. This is attributed to the use of heavy cream. Italian carbonara, on the other hand, makes use of beaten eggs with Pecorino Romano cheese and lots of ground black pepper for the sauce.</p>
        <p>The process in making the sauce for both versions varies. Filipino style carbonara sauce needs a little bit of cooking. The sauce for traditional carbonara is poured raw over warm pasta towards the end of the cooking process. The spaghetti is tossed while the sauce gets cooked slowly using residual heat from the pasta.</p>
